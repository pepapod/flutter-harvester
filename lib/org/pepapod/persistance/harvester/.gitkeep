Here we should put the abstractions of the persistance layer,
using a repository pattern structure, or a DAO approach

Here, each class should have a prefix that points what underlaying
implementation is being used. Like:

sqlite-user-profile-persistance.dart

All the clases included here in this package should implement an interface
that needs to be declared in:

persistance-declaration.dart
