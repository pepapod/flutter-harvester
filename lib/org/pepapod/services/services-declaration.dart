/// Here is the file where we will put all the services interfaces.
///
/// This file should only have abstract classes in the form of interfaces
///
/// Example:
///
/// abstract class UserProfileService {
///    Future<UserProfile> getUserProfile(String username);
/// }
///
///
/// Then, the interfaces here declared will be implemented on the ./harvester module
